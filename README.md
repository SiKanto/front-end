# 🌐 Laporan Proyek Front End - KANTO: Web Application - User & Admin Panel

A dual-role web application consisting of:
- **User App** (Frontend SPA with Vite + React + TypeScript)
- **Admin Dashboard** (React + TailwindCSS + CRACO)

## 🧩 Overview

This project aims to build an interactive and responsive web application through a full-stack development workflow—starting from UI/UX design, front-end implementation, back-end integration, and final deployment.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Process

### 1. 🎯 Research & Benchmarking
The process began with UI/UX research, including:
- Identifying similar applications for inspiration.
- Understanding user flow and required features.
- Creating design mood boards and wireframes.

### 2. 🖌 Prototyping with Figma
UI designs were crafted using **Figma**, focusing on:
- Clear navigation and accessibility.
- Mobile-first responsive layout.
- Visual hierarchy using color, size, and spacing.
